In January 2022, APQC released a survey report about process and
performance management challenges and priorities for the year. While the
full "2022 Process and Performance Management Priorities and Challenges"
report is available on the APQC website, there are a few areas I found
particularly interesting. Especially when those areas are viewed from the
lens of how the right technology platform can address performance
management challenges and help organizations move forward on these
priorities.
